Current Order Status Structure
Status	Purpose	View

Picking	Items are being picked in the warehouse	Open Orders
Ready for Dispatch	Fully picked and packed, waiting for courier pickup	Open Orders
Shipped	Order left warehouse, in transit	On Shipment

🧠 Why This Works Well
•	Operational focus: Your dashboard filters let each team see only what they need.
o	Warehouse team sees OPEN ORDERS.
o	Logistics sees ON SHIPMENT.
o	Customer support / finance can access ARCHIVE for resolved cases.
•	Minimized clutter: Once an order is delivered or cancelled, it moves out of the daily ops view.
•	Quick exception handling: Delivery Failed and Returned to Warehouse remain visible to take action.

✅ Optional Enhancements
1.	Add “Issue Flag” or Color
o	Visually highlight problematic statuses like:
	Delivery Failed (e.g., red icon)
	Returned to Warehouse (e.g., yellow icon)
o	Makes it easier to prioritize follow-up.

To make your order management workflow efficient and user-friendly, here's how I recommend laying out the screen designs for your operations dashboard, broken into 3 focused views: Open Orders, On Shipment, and Archive. Each should support quick scanning, filtering, and action-taking.

🛠️ UI/UX Tips
•	Use badges or chips for statuses (e.g., red = failed, green = delivered)
•	Use icons for courier services, payments, or alerts
•	Consider using tabs or segmented controls to switch between the three views
•	Make mobile-friendly: collapsible sections, swipe to change status, etc.
