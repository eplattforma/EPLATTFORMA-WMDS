5) GitHub hygiene: you still have sensitive / heavy artifacts tracked

You already discovered that cookies.txt is tracked by git (git ls-files … showed it). That file name strongly suggests credentials/session material.

Minimum action (do this even if you keep the repo public)

Add cookies.txt to .gitignore

Remove it from git tracking: git rm --cached cookies.txt

Commit + push

Rotate/replace anything that file might authenticate (treat as compromised)

If cookies.txt contains real session tokens, removing it in a later commit is not enough by itself because it remains in git history. In that case, the correct fix is history rewrite (filter-repo/BFG) or recreating the repo.

Also: your repo contains very large volumes of uploads/ and attached_assets/ (lots of xlsx/pdf/images). That’s not inherently wrong, but it will:

bloat clones

slow CI/deploys

increase the chance you accidentally commit something sensitive

For a production codebase, I strongly recommend ignoring:

uploads/

most of attached_assets/ (keep only required docs, not raw exports)

6) One production-specific lever to re-check: DB statement timeout

In app.py you set a production statement_timeout on the SQLAlchemy engine.
If your date import runs heavy queries (or concurrent load increases latency), this can cause mid-sync failures that you won’t reproduce in dev.

Recommendation:

For bulk imports, either temporarily increase the timeout or set it per session/transaction only for the sync job, not globally.

What I would do next (tight execution plan)

Fix the broken routes in routes_powersoft.py (/customers/<customer_code>, /jobs/<job_id>). 
GitHub

Confirm whether production failures are Flask exceptions or upstream timeouts by checking status code + Content-Type on the date import response.

If it’s timeout-related: make date import async-only in production (job + polling UI) and increase gunicorn/proxy timeout only if needed.

Remove cookies.txt from git tracking and rotate secrets.

Add retry/backoff + strict timeouts in ps365_client.call_ps365().
