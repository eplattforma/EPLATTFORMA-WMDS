Below are clear, implementation-ready instructions you can paste to Replit. They focus only on the immediate fixes needed to make time alerts fully UTC-consistent and avoid naive/aware datetime errors.

Implement immediate UTC fixes in time alert utilities.

Context:
- Our DB timestamps are stored in UTC (columns use UTCDateTime and defaults use get_utc_now).
- The alert utilities still use datetime.now() which is local + naive, and can cause:
  (a) TypeError when subtracting aware vs naive datetimes, or
  (b) wrong elapsed minutes if server time is local but DB timestamps are UTC.

Immediate changes (minimum scope):

1) In time_tracking_alert utilities (file that defines check_order_time_alerts / resolve_alert):
   - Replace ALL datetime.now() usage with timezone_utils.get_utc_now() (or naive UTC variant, depending on UTCDateTime behavior).

A) check_order_time_alerts():
   Current:
      now = datetime.now()
      elapsed_time = (now - start_log.timestamp).total_seconds() / 60
   Change to:
      from timezone_utils import get_utc_now
      now = get_utc_now()

   Then compute elapsed_time using now and start_log.timestamp.

   IMPORTANT: If UTCDateTime returns naive UTC datetimes from the DB, then use:
      now = get_utc_now().replace(tzinfo=None)
   so subtraction is between naive UTC and naive UTC.

B) resolve_alert():
   Current:
      alert.resolved_at = datetime.now()
   Change to:
      from timezone_utils import get_utc_now
      alert.resolved_at = get_utc_now()
   (or .replace(tzinfo=None) if UTCDateTime yields naive UTC)

2) Add a small helper inside the alert file to standardize “now” consistently:

   from timezone_utils import get_utc_now

   def _utc_now_for_db():
       n = get_utc_now()
       # If UTCDateTime stores/returns naive UTC in Python, strip tzinfo:
       # return n.replace(tzinfo=None)
       return n

   Use _utc_now_for_db() everywhere instead of datetime.now().

3) Quick safety test:
   - Run check_order_time_alerts() for an invoice that has a picking_started ActivityLog.
   - Confirm no exceptions and that elapsed_time increases correctly over time.
   - Resolve an alert and confirm resolved_at is populated and consistent with other UTC fields.

Deliverable:
- Commit code changes that remove datetime.now() from alert utilities and replac
