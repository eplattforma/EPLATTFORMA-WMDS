✅ Sample Prompt Summary
“Build a shipment management module with endpoints and an admin dashboard. I should be able to create shipments, assign completed orders to them, track delivery status per order (delivered or undelivered), and manage shipments by driver or route. The system must allow adding/removing orders and logging undelivered reasons.”
