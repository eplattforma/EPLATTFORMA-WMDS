✅ Section 4 (Updated): Picking Process for Picker Users
Section 4: Picking Process for Picker Users

I want to build the picking workflow for users with role = 'picker'.

1. After login, the picker should see a list of orders (invoices) assigned to them only.
   - Display the following fields:
     - INVOICE NO, ROUTING, CUSTOMER NAME
     - LINES, ITEMS, TOTAL WEIGHT, EXP TIME
     - STATUS: Not Started / In Progress / Completed
   - This screen should be mobile-friendly and allow the picker to click "Start Picking" for any assigned order.

2. When picking starts, present one item at a time on its own screen.

3. The item screen should include:
   - LOCATION (e.g., 10-02-A01) – displayed prominently with Aisle/Shelf/Level/Bin labels
   - ITEM NAME, ITEM CODE, BARCODE, ZONE
   - Quantity display as a single bold line:
     - If Pack is present and non-zero: `[QTY] [UNIT TYPE] [Pack]X` (e.g., `2 PACK 4X`)
     - If Pack is missing or zero: `[QTY] [UNIT TYPE]` (e.g., `1 CASE`)

4. Default behavior:
   - Picker confirms item by pressing a “Confirm Picked” button
   - The default picked quantity is the expected quantity

➡️  **4A. After pressing "Confirm Picked":**
   - A window (modal or overlay) should appear showing:
     - Product image (if available)
     - Product description
     - Barcode
     - Quantity to be picked
   - Picker is asked: **“Is this the correct product and quantity?”**
   - If confirmed: proceed to next item
   - If not confirmed: allow the picker to adjust quantity or report an issue

5. Exception handling:
   - If picker enters a smaller quantity than expected, this is logged as an **exception**
   - The exception log should include:
     - Invoice No, Item Code, Expected QTY, Picked QTY, Picker Username, Timestamp
   - These exceptions must appear in the final picking report for admin

6. After all items are picked:
   - Mark the invoice status as Completed
   - Redirect the picker to a completion screen
