Implement a flexible batch picking system that reuses the existing picking process and screens. Admin should choose the picking mode (Consolidated or Sequential) during batch creation.

---

🧩 1. Batch Creation

- Admin selects:
  - One or more zones (e.g. A1, B2)
  - Multiple open invoices (orders) that include items from those zones
  - A picking mode:
    - "Consolidated" → combine identical items across orders
    - "Sequential" → pick items order by order

- Store each batch with:
  - Unique batch ID
  - Zone(s)
  - List of included invoice IDs
  - Picking mode
  - Status = “In Progress”

---

📦 2. Picking Flow (Reusing Existing Screens)

- Use the **current item-by-item picking interface and logic**:
  - Show one item per screen (LOCATION, ITEM CODE, NAME, QTY, etc.)
  - Allow: ✅ Confirm Picked, ✏️ Adjust Quantity, 🚫 Mark as Not Picked, 🔁 Skip and Pick Later

- Apply the same skip rules: cannot finish batch until all items are either picked or resolved

- The only difference is how the items are **queued and grouped**, based on batch mode:

---

🟢 **If mode = Consolidated**:
- Use existing picking screens, but show each ITEM CODE only once
- Total quantity is the **sum across all orders**
- Picker confirms the full total
- Allocation logic splits picked quantity back to each order automatically

🟡 **If mode = Sequential**:
- Queue orders one by one
- For each order, show only items within the selected zone(s)
- Picker uses the same item-by-item screen for each order
- Skip and exception handling applies per order

---

🧾 3. Quantity Allocation (All Modes)

- After picking:
  - Update picked quantity per item **per order**
  - Handle partial quantities and exceptions
  - Prevent duplicate picking
  - Mark batch as “Completed” only when all items are resolved

---

🖨️ 4. Reports and Printouts

- Generate one picking report per order:
  - INVOICE NO, CUSTOMER NAME, ROUTING
  - Picked items with quantities and any exceptions

- Generate batch summary for admin:
  - Number of orders, total items picked, total exceptions
  - Optional PDF or print layout

---

⚙️ 5. Admin Interface

- Allow batch creation with:
  - Zone selection
  - Invoice filtering
  - Picking mode toggle (Consolidated / Sequential)

- Add batch history and status tracking
- Provide reassign/resolve screen for exceptions if needed

---

✅ Reuse:
- All existing item-picking UI, validations, button behaviors, and skip/exception logic must remain intact
- Only adjust the **picking queue generator** based on batch and mode
