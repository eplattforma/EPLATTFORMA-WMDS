✅ 🧠 Instructions for Replit AI
“Revamp the admin dashboard order list to use a global sorting system instead of individual column-based sorting. The new system should allow default sorting configuration based on multiple fields.”

✅ 1. Disable Column Sorting
Remove all per-column sorting buttons from the admin table UI.

Columns like “Customer Name” or “Invoice Number” should not be clickable for sorting anymore.

✅ 2. Add Default Sorting Settings Panel
Add a simple panel (or modal) where the admin can configure sorting preferences:

🎛️ Sorting Preferences UI:
Primary Sorting Field (dropdown):

status

routing

customer_name

invoice_number

Secondary Sorting Field (optional dropdown)

same options as above

Sort Direction (per field):

Ascending (A → Z)

Descending (Z → A)

✅ 3. Custom Status Sorting Logic
When sorting by status, use a predefined manual order (not alphabetical):

The status should be ordered as:

markdown
Copy code
1. Not Started
2. In Progress
3. Ready for Packing
4. Completed
In your code, map status like this:

js
Copy code
const statusOrder = {
  "Not Started": 1,
  "In Progress": 2,
  "Ready for Packing": 3,
  "Completed": 4
};
Use this order when sorting status, regardless of string name.

✅ 4. Store Sorting Settings
Save the admin’s sorting preferences in localStorage or database (optional).

Apply them as the default order every time the page loads.

Example settings object:

json
Copy code
{
  "primary_sort": "status",
  "primary_direction": "asc",
  "secondary_sort": "routing",
  "secondary_direction": "desc"
}
✅ 5. Apply Sorting Logic to Backend Query or Frontend Sort
If backend-driven: pass sorting config as query parameters:

http
Copy code
GET /orders?sort=status&direction=asc&secondary=routing&secondary_direction=desc
If frontend-driven: sort the already-fetched data using JS

✅ Example Flow
Admin opens order dashboard

Dashboard applies:

Primary sort: status (custom order)

Secondary sort: routing (ascending)

Column headers are no longer sortable

Admin can open a “Sorting Settings” modal to change logic

✅ Summary Prompt to Give Replit AI
“In the admin order dashboard, remove all per-column sorting. Instead, create a default sorting settings interface. Admin should be able to choose a primary and optional secondary sort field (status, routing, customer, invoice number) and direction (asc/desc). Status sorting must follow a fixed custom order: Not Started → In Progress → Ready for Packing → Completed. Store this config and apply it automatically on load. Do not allow column-click sorting anymore.”
