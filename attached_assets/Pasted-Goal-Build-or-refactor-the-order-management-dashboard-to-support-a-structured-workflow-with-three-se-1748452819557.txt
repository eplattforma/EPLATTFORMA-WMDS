Goal
Build or refactor the order management dashboard to support a structured workflow with three separate operational views:

Open Orders

On Shipment

Archive

✅ ORDER STATUSES AND VIEWS
Implement the following statuses with associated view assignments:

Status	Purpose	Assigned View
not_started	Order received, not yet picked	Open Orders
picking	Items are being picked	Open Orders
ready_for_dispatch	Fully picked and packed, waiting for courier pickup	Open Orders
shipped	Left warehouse, in transit	On Shipment
delivery_failed	Courier could not deliver	On Shipment
returned_to_warehouse	Returned due to failed delivery or customer return	Open Orders
delivered	Order successfully delivered	Archive
cancelled	Cancelled after shipping or return	Archive

🔹 VIEW 1: Open Orders
Purpose: Display all warehouse-stage orders (statuses: not_started, picking, ready_for_dispatch, returned_to_warehouse).

Layout:

Use the existing layout (e.g., Kanban columns or cards per status)

Group orders by their current status

Enable drag-and-drop (optional) or action buttons to change status

🔹 VIEW 2: On Shipment
Purpose: Show orders that are in transit or failed delivery.

Statuses: shipped, delivery_failed

Layout (table-based):

Header:  [Courier Filters] [Search Bar] [Bulk Actions Dropdown]

Make the UI mobile-responsive:

Use collapsible sections

Ensure swipe-friendly status changes if using cards
